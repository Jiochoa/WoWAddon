# Objective 
The objective of this page is to explain a Design Pattern and do something with it as practice. Maybe add tags for the situation in which it would be useful. I will be using the Head First Design Pattern book.

Theres a total of 23 patterns, the book only covers 12 so I'll have to get the other from somewhere else.

## Notes
I might need something to set the book down. I have the space so I just need a stand. Again, one of the things that I will focus is to keep my hands in the keybaord at all time. Its supposed to be more productive but I'm still not sure about it.
