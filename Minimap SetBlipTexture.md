# Minimap:SetBlipTexture()

Seems like it was the solution that I wanted, but I was wrong. It doesn't seem to be working as it supposed to, or at least I don't know how to get it to work.

```
void Minimap:SetBlipTexture()
Arguments: file_path

```

Some posts say that it's supposed to crash if no argument is there, but it doesn't do anything at all, with or with a nonsense path.

There was a **Red flag** to look out for which was when solving problems. That sometimes youll get stuck solving a sub-solution that doesnt get you closer to solving the actual problem. I forgot the name.
