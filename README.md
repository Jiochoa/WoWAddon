The Purpose of this Addon is to make it easier to isolate the herbs that we need from all the rest, so we don't waste time gathering herbs that we don't need.

- Source code repository at GitHub:


## Functionality
This Addon should identify the type of herbs that are in the map without having to hover over them with your mouse. As a side thing, I would also like to give the option to have a special list and make a selected sound every time one of those selected herbs appear on the Mini-Map.

## Development Information
